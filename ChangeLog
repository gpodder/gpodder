        * src/gpodder/librssreader.py: Make sorting a single step by using
          sort( reverse = True) instead of sort() + reverse() -- thanks to

        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add can_sort_by_pubdate() to 
          podcastChannel and add __cmp__() to podcastItem to enable sorting 
          of podcastChannel items by pubDate (ascending, descending by using
          reverse()..)
        * src/gpodder/librssreader.py: If after parsing a RSS file it is 
          possible to sort the resulting channel by pubDate, do so
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Omit output of excessive episodes if there
          are more than ten new episodes (so everything fits on the screen 
          nicely); thanks to Michel Salim for reporting this and the bug 
          above (channel with wrongly sorted episodes in RSS file)
        * bin/gpodder: version + release date bump

Sat, 10 Mar 2007 18:35:41 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

          remove _very_ old getWebData and downloadProcedure functions)
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Fix error callback when download fails 
          and we do not have a backup cache file to restore
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Re-factor showMessage and showConfirmation 
          to show_message() and show_confirmation(), respectively and make the
          dialog creation as suggested in the Gnome HIG; update all invocations
          of showMessage and showConfirmation to give better feedback on what
          is going on; also clean up some things in gPodderEpisode dialog
        * data/gpodder.glade: Fix some things in gPodderEpisode dialog and 
          use the "gtk-down" icon for download buttons

Sat, 10 Mar 2007 16:52:22 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Support cancelling downloading an RSS 
          file by supplying a callback_is_cancelled variable that should
          return True when the download should be cancelled (and the old, 
          backed up cache file [if any] be used instead); additionally, get 
          rid of gtk events_pending code, as we call downloadRss only in 
          threads as of now
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Support for cancelling the read() 
          operation of a gPodderChannelReader (uses old cache files instead)
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Re-design of the update feed cache dialog 
          following Gnome HIG guidelines for progress windows and making 
          use of the update_feed_cache() function (which now is threaded) in 
          every part of the gpodder window code; also provide the option of
          cancelling a running update of the feed cache :)

Thu,  8 Mar 2007 13:20:02 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/librssreader.py: Keep track of a "parse_tree" variable 
          and check that the elements that set channel metadata are just below
          the <channel> item; this bug has been spotted while examining RSS 
          feeds on Radio Canada that have a <image> item which <title> tags 
          would be mis-interpreted by gPodder as being the channel's title

Thu,  8 Mar 2007 13:05:29 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/liblocdbreader.py, src/gpodder/liblocdbwriter.py: Add
          support for override_title in channel's gpodder:info, so we can set 
          a custom title to be displayed in the GUI
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add support for override_title (custom
          title set by the user) and handle feeds with missing/empty title 
          gracefully (display URL as title instead)
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Read metadata from localdb when reading 
          the channel list (so we get the override_title if it is set
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Fix typo for channel adding; update combo 
          box on channel properties change (for custom title); add support 
          for custom title to Gpodderchannel dialog handling code
        * data/gpodder.glade: Add custom title to the gPodder channel dialog
	  Thanks to Konstantin Ryabitsev (mricon.com) for suggesting this

          window title if we're running a svn version of gPodder; use the new 
          sanitize_feed_url function from libgpodder; small clean-ups
        * bin/gpodder: Description in docstring; better handling of command 
          line arguments and calling of gpodder.console functions; the old 
          --debug flag is now called --local (makes more sense, after all)
        * Makefile: Don't run generators on "make release"; use new --local 
          and --verbose flags for "make test"; specify application name in 
          help2man call for manpage generation

          that when compiling PyID3 from source, its name will be lowercase, 
          so we simply check for both cases now (all uppercase/all lowercase)

          added change_notification parameter to downloadStatusManager
        * src/gpodder/console.py: Only download episodes that are newer 
          than the latest downloaded episodes (like the "download new" 
          button) when running "gpodder -r" (as suggested by Stephen, 
          "urban at inetdesign.org" a while ago)
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Refactor isDownloaded() to new name

          to podcastChannel, added compare_pubdate() and newer_pubdate() 
          to podcastItem to enable getting most recent "pubDate" of the 
          downloaded episodes list (for finding "new" episodes, see below)
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Update list of available episodes when
          switching notebook tabs (to mark downloaded episodes with another 
          color); ask user to download some new episodes after a channel 
          has been added; handle "download new" button to download either

        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Use shutil.rmtree() instead of 
          hand-crafted folder remove code in remove_downloaded();
          convert deleteDownloadedItemByUrlAndTitle() to a simpler 
          delete_episode_by_url() function (and get rid of duplicate 
          code in the process)
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Fix static<->object variables in 
          gPodderLibClass, re-factor downloaddir in a property that 
          automatically tries to move the downloaded folder when it 
          changes; also save download_dir as a config file value
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Fix the delete single/multiple episodes 
          in a downloaded channel bug introduced by last commit (thanks

Tue,  5 Dec 2006 23:36:41 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
	* svn branch gpodder-thp-december-2006: This branch will be 
	  used to develop and test the new filenaming scheme and some 
	  code clean-ups. After the code has been tested and the 
	  codebase seems stable, this branch will be merged back into 
	  the gpodder trunk. This codebase breaks compatibility with 
	  the old download directory scheme, but also makes the code 
	  simpler and easier to manage. See below for the first cut of 
	  these changes and enjoy!            -- Thomas Perl
        * src/gpodder/liblocdbreader.py: Code clean-ups, utilize real 
          channel URL when reading localdb
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Code clean-ups; new file naming 
          scheme; remove unnecessary download_dir property (you just 
          want to use save_dir instead); add remove_cache_file() and 
          remove_downloaded() methods to podcastChannel; remove support 
          for legacy (pre-0.7) filename locations - the old download 
          directory scheme is not supported anymore with this change; 
          channelsToModel function code cleanup
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Do not save channel name in the 
          gPodder channel list (because the name will be calculated 
          depending on the URL as of now); simplify the channel reading 
          process by getting rid of the "filename-discovery" code parts
          and do not read in the download_dir variable for the channel
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Clear available episodes list when 
          there are no channels selected; do not disable/enable menu 
          items based on which page of the gtknotebook we are; only 
          fetch channel feed once, because we do not need to fetch it
          twice with the new channel naming scheme; added support for 
          feed:// URLs; remove downloaded items when removing a channel;
          some more code clean-ups to increase code readability
        * src/gpodder/liblocaldb.py: Major code overhaul, cleanup and 
          simplification; getting rid of camelCasedFunctionNames

Wed, 22 Nov 2006 17:02:23 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Add support for pymad, because
          it gives more correct track length of MP3 files for me; 
          if pymad is not installed, gPodder will fallback to eyeD3;
          if you only installed eyeD3 for gPodder, you can remove it 
          now and install pymad instead
        * README: Note pymad dependency (and now-optional eyeD3)

        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Fixed a stupid bug that prevented you

          anyone notice this bug before? ;)

        * src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Applied patch from Nick (nikosapi 
          gmail com) to add file size to iTunesDB. This should fix the

	  from Alain Tauch to fix a bug in liblocaldb.py; re-factored the

	  appear and requires a restart of gPodder" problem :)

	  the 0.8.0 release

	* Applied a modified version of Camille's patch to get videos
