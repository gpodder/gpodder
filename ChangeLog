        * src/gpodder/libwget.py: Don't log wget's output for now (too 
          noisy for testing, also wget seems to be stable for gPodder);
          added change_notification parameter to downloadStatusManager
        * src/gpodder/console.py: Only download episodes that are newer 
          than the latest downloaded episodes (like the "download new" 
          button) when running "gpodder -r" (as suggested by Stephen, 
          "urban at inetdesign.org" a while ago)
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Refactor isDownloaded() to new name 
          is_downloaded() in podcastChannel; add a downloading_callback 
          parameter to getItemsModel(); have new colors for available 
          episodes list (green, orange-red and white)
        * src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Check if iTunesDB has a master 
          and a podcasts playlist, bug out if there is none; also fix 
          some minor problems that might lead to crashes
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: update available tree view when the 
          downloadStatusManager reports a change; mark "downloading" 
          episodes with special color; when adding a channel that already 
          exists, switch the available podcasts view to the existing 
          channel; download "newer" episodes with the same timestamp as 
          the latest downloaded podcast; fix indentation
        * TODO: Removed items marked as done already

Wed,  6 Dec 2006 17:49:43 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Added newest_pubdate_downloaded() 
          to podcastChannel, added compare_pubdate() and newer_pubdate() 
          to podcastItem to enable getting most recent "pubDate" of the 
          downloaded episodes list (for finding "new" episodes, see below)
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Update list of available episodes when
          switching notebook tabs (to mark downloaded episodes with another 
          color); ask user to download some new episodes after a channel 
          has been added; handle "download new" button to download either 
          the three newest episodes (if no downloads yet) or all episodes 
          that are newer than the newest downloaded episode
        * data/gpodder.glade: Added "download new" button for downloading 
          episodes as described above

	  after the changes above
	* bin/gpodder: update release date and version

Wed,  6 Dec 2006 03:36:51 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/libwget.py: Clean up downloadStatusManager 
          and add support for a GTK window that will have its 
          title updated based on the current download status (show 
          total download progress in titlebar of gPodder window)
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Send the main window to the 
          downloadStatusManager object so it can access the window 
          title
        * data/gpodder.glade: Main window title is now "gPodder"

Wed,  6 Dec 2006 02:59:10 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

        * TODO: Remove items on TODO list that have been done now

Wed,  6 Dec 2006 02:26:43 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Use shutil.rmtree() instead of 
          hand-crafted folder remove code in remove_downloaded();
          convert deleteDownloadedItemByUrlAndTitle() to a simpler 
          delete_episode_by_url() function (and get rid of duplicate 
          code in the process)
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Fix static<->object variables in 
          gPodderLibClass, re-factor downloaddir in a property that 
          automatically tries to move the downloaded folder when it 
          changes; also save download_dir as a config file value
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Fix the delete single/multiple episodes 
          in a downloaded channel bug introduced by last commit (thanks 
          to Seth Remington for testing and reporting this :)
          Make Gpodderproperties open a FileChooserDialog to select 
          download directory
        * data/gpodder.glade: Make "download to" input field a button 
          that (when clicked) opens a folder chooser dialog

Tue,  5 Dec 2006 23:36:41 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
	* svn branch gpodder-thp-december-2006: This branch will be 
	  used to develop and test the new filenaming scheme and some 
	  code clean-ups. After the code has been tested and the 
	  codebase seems stable, this branch will be merged back into 
	  the gpodder trunk. This codebase breaks compatibility with 
	  the old download directory scheme, but also makes the code 
	  simpler and easier to manage. See below for the first cut of 
	  these changes and enjoy!            -- Thomas Perl
        * src/gpodder/liblocdbreader.py: Code clean-ups, utilize real 
          channel URL when reading localdb
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Code clean-ups; new file naming 
          scheme; remove unnecessary download_dir property (you just 
          want to use save_dir instead); add remove_cache_file() and 
          remove_downloaded() methods to podcastChannel; remove support 
          for legacy (pre-0.7) filename locations - the old download 
          directory scheme is not supported anymore with this change; 
          channelsToModel function code cleanup
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Do not save channel name in the 
          gPodder channel list (because the name will be calculated 
          depending on the URL as of now); simplify the channel reading 
          process by getting rid of the "filename-discovery" code parts
          and do not read in the download_dir variable for the channel
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Clear available episodes list when 
          there are no channels selected; do not disable/enable menu 
          items based on which page of the gtknotebook we are; only 
          fetch channel feed once, because we do not need to fetch it
          twice with the new channel naming scheme; added support for 
          feed:// URLs; remove downloaded items when removing a channel;
          some more code clean-ups to increase code readability
        * src/gpodder/liblocaldb.py: Major code overhaul, cleanup and 
          simplification; getting rid of camelCasedFunctionNames
	* bin/gpodder: Note version and release date for svn branch

Mon,  4 Dec 2006 14:04:04 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

          only the artwork files to share/gpodder/images
        * Makefile: Generate 22x22 and 48x48 icons from gpodder.png
        * README: Note "imagemagick" as new developer dependency - 
          this is needed for the new image conversion in Makefile
        * data/gpodder.glade: Added three new links to help menu
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Added three new link handlers for

Sun,  3 Dec 2006 19:07:27 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

	  after download is cancelled or an error occured
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Added clean_up_downloads() function 
	  to gPodderLibClass to do some housekeeping in the download 
	  directory (remove temporary files from old sessions and remove 
	  empty download directories)

	  gPodder starts
        * bin/gpodder: Minor code cleanup, bumped version + release date

Fri,  1 Dec 2006 15:42:07 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

        * TODO: Updated TODO list

Wed, 22 Nov 2006 17:02:23 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Add support for pymad, because
          it gives more correct track length of MP3 files for me; 
          if pymad is not installed, gPodder will fallback to eyeD3;
          if you only installed eyeD3 for gPodder, you can remove it 
          now and install pymad instead
        * README: Note pymad dependency (and now-optional eyeD3)
        * doc/dev/ipod-sync.txt: State that pymad is now preferred

Wed, 22 Nov 2006 16:13:33 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

Mon, 20 Nov 2006 13:33:00 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Fixed a stupid bug that prevented you 
          from changing a channel's url in the channel editor (didn't 
          anyone notice this bug before? ;)

Mon, 20 Nov 2006 12:46:54 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
        * src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Added one_line_description() to 
          podcastItem; modified getItemsModel to return description
        * src/gpodder/gpodder.py: Added description to "available 
          episodes" list; made columns resizable and reorderable and 
          added "ellipsize" property to both name and description field
	* bin/gpodder: bumped release date again (wonder if we should 
	  use svn:keywords on that file some time soon ;)

        * src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Applied patch from Nick (nikosapi 
          gmail com) to add file size to iTunesDB. This should fix the 
          constant disk spinning on 5G iPods. Thanks :)

        * src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Applied modified patch from (nikosapi

        * src/gpodder/liblogger.py: Added new logging facility
        * src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Removed isDebugging() and debug flag
        * src/gpodder/*: Use new liblogger instead of isDebugging() in
          libwget.py, liblocdbreader.py, libplayers.py, libpodcasts.py,
          libgpodder.py, libipodsync.py, gpodder.py and liblocaldb.py
        * TODO: Updated TODO list

	  from Alain Tauch to fix a bug in liblocaldb.py; re-factored the 
	  whole module to get rid of caching cruft and old code; this 
	  should also fix the long-standing "new downloaded channel doesn't
	  appear and requires a restart of gPodder" problem :)
        * bin/gpodder: bumped version + release date

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Improvements in get_filename

	  the 0.8.0 release
	* References to 0.8 have been changed to 0.8.0 - gpodder

	  so we can put out smaller bugfix releases (0.8.1, etc..)

	* Applied a modified version of Camille's patch to get videos 
	  (mov, mp4, m4v) working with iPod video devices on sync -

	* Applied patch from Adrien Beaucreux to make the podcastChannel 
	  class act like a Python list and therefore make code more cute
