changes to your repo. In order to do so ensure the necessary packages are
installed by executing:

```shell
pip3 install pytest-cov pycodestyle isort requests pytest pytest-httpserver
```

Execute the linter in the root directory (Linux only): `make lint unittest`. On
Windows execute: `pycodestyle share src/gpodder tools bin/* *.py`
