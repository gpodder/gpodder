#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Example script that can be used as post-play extension in media players
#
# Set the configuration options "audio_played_dbus" and "video_played_dbus"
# to True to let gPodder leave the played status untouched when playing
# files in the media player. After playback has finished, call this script
# with the filename of the played episodes as single argument. The episode
# will be marked as played inside gPodder.
#
# Usage: gpodder_mark_played.py /path/to/episode.mp3
#        (the gPodder GUI has to be running)
