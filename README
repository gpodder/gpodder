 OLD Release Branch Notice
 =========================

 tl;dr: Go to http://gpodder.org/ and download a newer release (>= 3.0.4).

 This is gPodder 2.20.x, the bugfix series on top of gPodder 2.20. Please note
 that gPodder 3.0.0 was released in November 2011. Since then, the 2.x branch
 of gPodder has been deprecated, and is only occassionally (if at all) updated
 with bug fixes or patches by the community.

 It is recommended for users to upgrade to gPodder 3. The platforms Maemo 4
 (N800, N810) and Maemo 5 (N900 using the Gtk/Hildon UI) are not supported by
 gPodder 3 anymore - they receive updates via the 2.20.x releases only (and
 these platforms are the only reason for the existence of 2.20.x releases).

                                          -- Thomas Perl, February 2012

   * python-feedparser
   * python-mygpoclient (>= 1.4; http://thp.io/2010/mygpoclient/)
   * python-dbus (optional, but highly recommended)

 If your Python installation does not come with "sqlite3" support,
 you can either re-compile Python with support for sqlite3 or use

   * libmtp (>= 1.0.0)
     Please note that the previously-required "pymtp" module is now included in

     needed as special dependency. You still need a recent version of libmtp.

 Installation
 ============

 Extract the tar archive somewhere into your home directory and cd into 
 the directory where you extracted it, for example:

   tar xzvf gpodder-2.20.tar.gz
   cd gpodder-2.20/
   make install

 If you have any problems, please visit the gPodder website or mail the 
 gPodder mailing list (see below for more information).

 You can set the environment variables GPODDER_HOME and GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR
 to point to locations for storing the database and downloaded files:

    GPODDER_HOME ........... location for configuration and database

 You can use this to have different configurations for gPodder or to put
 gPodder's data directly on your MP3 player or USB disk, for example:

    export GPODDER_HOME=/media/usbdisk/gpodder-data/
    export GPODDER_DOWLOAD_DIR=/media/usbdisk/podcasts/
    gpodder
