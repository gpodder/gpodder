 Extract the tar archive somewhere into your home directory and cd into 
 the directory where you extracted it, for example:

   tar xzvf gpodder-2.6.tar.gz
   cd gpodder-2.6/
   make install

 If you have any problems, please visit the gPodder website or mail the 
 gPodder mailing list (see below for more information).

 ================================
 Portable mode / roaming profiles

 You can set the environment variables GPODDER_HOME and GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR
 to point to locations for storing the database and downloaded files:

    GPODDER_HOME ........... location for configuration and database
    GPODDER_DOWNLOAD_DIR ... location for downloaded episodes

 You can use this to have different configurations for gPodder or to put
 gPodder's data directly on your MP3 player or USB disk, for example:

    export GPODDER_HOME=/media/usbdisk/gpodder-data/
    export GPODDER_DOWLOAD_DIR=/media/usbdisk/podcasts/
    gpodder
