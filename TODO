 
 * My favourite Videocast offers 3gp-Files (for mobiles) and m4v-Files 
   (for iPods) in his feed.gPodder loads the low quality m4v-File, which 
   is not only low quality, kaffeine can't even play it.  How can I 
   change the behaviour to load the m4-File?  Maybe a list with filetype
   priorities would help. (suggested by Timm Preetz <timm -- preetz us>)

 * In preferences dialog, have two choices for programs (one for video 
   podcasts, one for audio podcasts)
                   (suggested by Philipp Ottlinger, otg@aiki-it.de)

 -------------------------

 * i would like to have a button that will download all new files in all
   channels that are subscribed. An option in preferences that will
   autostart this process after startup would be also a nice feature :-)
      (suggested by Robert Pankowecki <robert.pankowecki     gmail.com>)

      -> partially done already

 -------------------------

 * Make (at least optional) it possible to populate MP3 files' tags from 
   the metadata found in the feed. Possible options:
   
    -> Never populate MP3 files
    -> Only populate when MP3 files don't yet have tags
    -> Always populate; overwrite old tags if existing

   (Thanks to ubunt2@gmail.com for suggesting the metadata populate feat.)

 * in libipodsync.py: use mime magic instead of extension-based 
   video detection? --> also, is mp4 always video or could it be 
   aac audio too? if so, how to check what is what?
   
   according to http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&threadid=62723, 
   mp4 files can be both audio and video files.. m4v and m4a are wrong 
   extensions introduced by apple.. maybe a stripped-down mime magic 
   detection could do the trick? (we only need to detect the file types 
   supported by ipods, after all.. mp3, aac, wav, mov, mp4-video, ..?)

 * Suggestion by Marius Scurtescu <marius.scurtescu at gmail dot com>:
   - add the download progress to the same Available Podcasts tab and
     then you don't need the Download Status tab at all, this will allow
     you to see what is downloaded and what not
 
 * libipodsync
   -> maybe delete podcasts that are deleted locally but still on ipod
 
 * do more translations (you can contribute here, of course :)
 
 * maybe a "all channels view"
